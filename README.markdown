#Handcrafted Compass Mixins

##Examples?

See the [wiki](http://wiki.github.com/handcrafted/handcrafted-compass-mixins) for more details.

##Introduction

Handcrafted is all about OS code sharing. [Compass](http://compass-style.org/) rocks and we tend to write mixins that suite our needs and help us enjoy life just a bit more than we otherwise would.
